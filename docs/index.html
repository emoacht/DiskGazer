<h1>What Wave In Your Drive?</h1>

<p>Do you know waves in a hard disk drive?</p>

<p>These colorful line charts illustrate the transfer rates at 5 different locations in a 1TB hard disk drive. You can see repetitive waves that gradually change their forms and lengths. The below is the full chart.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have seen charts like this before. If you had a chance to zoom in a specific location, you would see waves there (I call plateaus of various heights "wave" not spikes upward or downward).</p>
<p>Here is the charts of another hard disk drive. You can see waves of different forms.</p>

<p>Are they just meaningless noises?</p>
<p>- No, not at all. They are real and perfectly reproducible. If you use a measuring tool which has enough fineness, you can see them.</p>

<p>Dose it happen to these drives only?</p>
<p>- No, not at all. As far as I know, all modern hard disk drives have their own wave forms. To be accurate, <u>every unit of every model of hard disk drive has its own unique wave forms.</u></p>

<p>So what are these waves?</p>
<p>- I have no clear answer. However, I have a hypothesis that <u>each plateau represents a group of tracks in a zone on a recording surface of a platter in a hard disk drive.</u> There is no other reasonable explanation on them. If I try to describe how I have reached this idea, it would be a little bit long story.</p>
